Typeahead Formula Search
---
 
This page allows the user to search for a variety of Excel-like functions with a search bar that utilizes React.js and typeahead.js. As the user types, a dropdown with a list of functions the user might be trying to type will appear. Clicking any of these functions will autofill the search bar and allow the user to complete the other function parameters.

The page is completely responsive thanks to Bootstrap. The user is provided with extensive instructions to get started, which include descriptions of all the available functions, fields and comparators, and how to combine them all to write a formula.
